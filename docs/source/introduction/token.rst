Authorization Token
===================

Any request to the rest API service must contain the oidc access token granted 
to the users once they have entered the HBP Collaboratory. 

The request to the service account is fullfilled after the validity of the 
token is verified. 

In order to know more on the Native application flow on the HBP Collaboratory,
please refer to: `HBP Collaboratory Native application flow <https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/54/nav/35256>`_.

Job ids, user ids and  requested resources are stored in the service backend 
database.
